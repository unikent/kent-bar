# kent-bar
The new Kent bar will be a replacement for the [current Kent nav bar](https://github.com/unikent/kent-nav-bar). The new version will allow personalisation for staff and students if they are logged in via SSO to allow them to quickly access the services relevant to them.

It is a [Backbone.js app](http://backbonejs.org/)
